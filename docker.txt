Docker container is a lightweight high performance software package that contains all needed information to execute an application.
When to use
1) Run multiples applications separately without dependency
2) Creates environment to start with a new tool saving installation and configuration
3) Creates a environment close to the production environment so developers won't need to use a remote one
